## Prerequisites ##

* [Visual Studio 2017]

## Implementation ##

I have build a solution using Asp .Net Core to acheive this requirement. I have created a Asp .Net Core MVC project which has various layers and the given service is called from the Service Layer of the application.
I wanted to use this oppurtunity to explore new technology and also showcase my skills in that.

Some of the advantages of using Asp .Net Core:

* Its platform independent. It can be run and Deployed on Windows/Linux/MacOS.
* Light weight when compared to Asp .Net 4.0.
